# Presentation notes for 9-05

Two ways to add intrinsic activity and temperature dependence:

- [x] model conductances with a temperature dependent process and increase noise of ORN.
- [ ] Model OR with a temperature dependent stochastic process.
- [ ] See which ones behaves better in the odor-presenting protocols.
